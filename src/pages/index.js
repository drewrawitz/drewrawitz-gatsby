    <p>
      I enjoy playing with cutting edge web technologies and building beautiful
      websites. My job involves doing what I love, developing new websites and
      applications. I absolutely love learning new things and taking on new
      challenges. A more detailed look at my professional capabilities and
      experience is available in my resume, which is available upon request.
